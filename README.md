CSS Image View
==============

A simple two column layout with index of images in the left and a bigger image in the right. Click on left index to see the bigger image in right side of the page. 

This is a clean neat UI built with HTML + CSS without any Javascript. 

See screenshot.jpg to see how it looks.
